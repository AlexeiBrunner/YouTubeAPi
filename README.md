INSTALLATION
------------
If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

Update dependencies with Composer:

~~~
composer update
~~~

Need to complete migrations:

~~~
yii migrate
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `basic` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~

CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.

CRON
-------------

To complete the database, you must run the cron:

~~~
0 * * * * /path/to/project/yii daemon/hourly
~~~
